Confluence Server is where you create, organise and discuss work with your team. Capture the knowledge that's too often lost in email inboxes and shared network drives in Confluence – where it's easy to find, use, and update. Give every team, project, or department its own space to create the things they need, whether it's meeting notes, product requirements, file lists, or project plans, you can get more done in Confluence.

# Overview

This is a refactored version from https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/docker-atlassian-confluence-server using https://hub.docker.com/r/anapsix/alpine-java/ for offical java. 
 
This Docker container makes it easy to get an instance of Confluence up and running.
 
# Quick Start
 
For the directory in the environmental variable `CONFLUENCE_HOME` that is used to store Confluence data
(amongst other things) we recommend mounting a host directory as a [data volume](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume):
 
Start Atlassian Confluence Server:
 
    $> docker run -v /data/your-confluence-home:/var/atlassian/application-data/confluence --name="confluence" -d -p 8090:8090 -p 8091:8091 atlassian/confluence-server
 

**Success**. Confluence is now available on [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)*
 
Please ensure your container has the necessary resources allocated to it.
We recommend 2GiB of memory allocated to accommodate the application server.
See [Supported Platforms](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Supported+platforms) for further information.
     
 
_* Note: If you are using `docker-machine` on Mac OS X, please use `open http://$(docker-machine ip default):8090` instead._
 
# Upgrade
 
To upgrade to a more recent version of Confluence Server you can simply stop the `Confluence`
container and start a new one based on a more recent image:
 
    $> docker stop confluence
    $> docker rm confluence
    $> docker run ... (see above)
 
As your data is stored in the data volume directory on the host, it will still
be available after the upgrade.
 
_Note: Please make sure that you **don't** accidentally remove the `confluence`
container and its volumes using the `-v` option._
 
# Backup
 
For evaluating Confluence you can use the built-in database that will store its files in the Confluence Server home directory. In that case it is sufficient to create a backup archive of the directory on the host that is used as a volume (`/data/your-confluence-home` in the example above).
 
Confluence's [automatic backup](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Configuring+Backups) is currently supported in the Docker setup. You can also use the [Production Backup Strategy](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Production+Backup+Strategy) approach if you're using an external database.
